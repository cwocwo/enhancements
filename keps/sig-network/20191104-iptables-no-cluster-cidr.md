## Summary

The iptables implementation of kube-proxy today references to the cluster CIDR for pods in three places
for the following reasons.

   1. [Allowing for access to service IPs from outside the cluster, by masquerading with the NodeIP
      for inbound traffic](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L887-L894)
   2. [Redirecting pods traffic to external loadbalancer VIP to cluster IP](
      https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L1248-L1260)
   3. [Accepting traffic after the first packet, after being accepted by kubernetes rules](
      https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L1389-L1411)

This enhancement proposes ways to achieve similar goals without tracking the pod cluster CIDR to do so.

## Motivation

The idea that makes kubernetes networking model unique and powerful is the concept of each pod 
having it's own IP, with all the pod IPs being natively routable within the cluster. The service chains
in iptable rules depend on this capability by assuming that they can treat all the endpoints of a
cluster as being equivalent and load balancer service traffic across all the endpoints, but just
translating destination to the pod IP address.

While this is powerful, it also means pod IP addresses are in many cases the constraining resource
for cluster creation and scale. It would be valuable for implementations to have different strategies
for managing pod IP addresses that can adapt to different environment needs. 

Some examples of use cases:

   * Creating a cluster out of many disjoint ranges instead of a single range.
   * Expanding a cluster with more disjoint ranges after initial creation.

Not having to depend on the cluster pod CIDR for routing service traffic would effectively de-couple
pod IP management and allocation strategies from service management and routing. 
Which in turn would mean that it would be far cheaper to evolve the IP allocation schemes while
sharing the same service implementation, thus significantly lowering the bar for adoption of
alternate schemes.

### Goals

   * Not having to depend on the cluster pod CIDR for iptable rules and cluster traffic routing.

### Non-Goals

   * Providing alternate models of IP allocation schemes for pod CIDR.
   * Enhancing current allocators to handle disjoint ranges.
   * Enhancing current allocators to add additional ranges after cluster create. 

## Proposal

As stated above, the goal is to re-implement the functionality called out in the summary, but in a 
way that does not depend on a pod cluster CIDR. The essence of the proposal is that for the 
first two cases, we can replace the `-s proxier.clusterCIDR` with one of:

   1. `-s node.podCIDR` (where we don't have control of pod interface naming convention)
   2. `--in-interface prefix+` (where all pod interfaces start with same prefix)
   3. `-m physdev --physdev-is-in` (where we use kubenet as it is bridged)

In each cases, we are effectively replacing reference to cluster CIDR with some notion of locally
generated pod traffic. The three options show the three ways of determining the originating
traffic as local pod generated. The second and third variant have the added advantage, where
it can be used to allow for future evolution of node podCIDR without having to track kube-proxy
changes.

For the last case, the proposal is to drop the reference to the cluster CIDR.

Which of the option to use would be controlled by kube-proxy flags as one solution might not fit
all cases. The reasoning behind why this works are as follows.

### Allowing access to service IPs from outside the cluster

The [rule here currently](
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L887-L894
) looks as follows

```go
// This masquerades off-cluster traffic to a service VIP.  The idea
// is that you can establish a static route for your Service range,
// routing to any node, and that node will bridge into the Service
// for you.  Since that might bounce off-node, we masquerade here.
// If/when we support "Local" policy for VIPs, we should update this.
writeLine(proxier.natRules, append(args, "! -s", proxier.clusterCIDR, "-j", string(KubeMarkMasqChain))...)
```

The logic is that if the source IP is not part of the cluster CIDR range,
then it must have originated from outside the cluster. Hence we add a rule to masquerade by
the node IP so that we can send traffic to any pod within the cluster.

One key insight when thinking about this data path though is the fact that the ip table rules run
at _every_ node boundary. So when a pod sends a traffic to a service IP, it get's translated to
one of the node IPs _before_ it leaves the node at the node boundary. So it's highly unlikely to 
receive traffic at a node, whose destination is the service cluster IP, that is initiated by pods
within the cluster, but not scheduled within that node.

Going by the above reasoning, if we receive traffic whose source is not within the node podCIDR,
we can say with very high confidence that the traffic originated from outside the cluster. This
would be simplest change with respect to re-writing the rule without any assumptions on how the
pod networking is setup.

In cases where we have consistent naming conventions for the pod interfaces (when not using kubenet),
we can replace node's podCIDR with the interface prefix for all the pods. This would be an equivalent 
way of saying that the traffic originated from nodes inside the cluter, without depending on 
pod IPs in any form.

Further, assuming that a kubernetes node is only used for kubernetes workloads, when running 
kubenet, we can use "originated from the bridge" as yet another way of saying it cluster originated
traffic without depending on pod IPs in any form.

### Redirecting pod traffic to external VIP to cluster IP

The [rule here currently](
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L1248-L1260
) looks as follows

```go
// First rule in the chain redirects all pod -> external VIP traffic to the
// Service's ClusterIP instead. This happens whether or not we have local
// endpoints; only if clusterCIDR is specified
if len(proxier.clusterCIDR) > 0 {
  args = append(args[:0],
    "-A", string(svcXlbChain),
    "-m", "comment", "--comment",
    `"Redirect pods trying to reach external loadbalancer VIP to clusterIP"`,
    "-s", proxier.clusterCIDR,
    "-j", string(svcChain),
  )
  writeLine(proxier.natRules, args...)
}
```

The logic here is that if the source IP is part of cluster CIDR and we detect that is being
sent to a load balancer IP for a service, we short circuit it by jumping directly to the
service chain instead of having the packet go out of the cluster, get routed back and then
translated to one of the backends.

Given that iptable rules are applied at the node boundary before any traffic from pods within
that node leave the node, the same arguments above apply here for replacing the cluster CIDR
with a representation of pod's nodeCIDR or it's interfaces.

### Accepting traffic after first packet, after being accepted by kubernetes rules

The rule here looks as follows

```go
// The following rules can only be set if clusterCIDR has been defined.
if len(proxier.clusterCIDR) != 0 {
  // The following two rules ensure the traffic after the initial packet
  // accepted by the "kubernetes forwarding rules" rule above will be
  // accepted, to be as specific as possible the traffic must be sourced
  // or destined to the clusterCIDR (to/from a pod).
  writeLine(proxier.filterRules,
    "-A", string(kubeForwardChain),
    "-s", proxier.clusterCIDR,
    "-m", "comment", "--comment", `"kubernetes forwarding conntrack pod source rule"`,
    "-m", "conntrack",
    "--ctstate", "RELATED,ESTABLISHED",
    "-j", "ACCEPT",
  )
  writeLine(proxier.filterRules,
    "-A", string(kubeForwardChain),
    "-m", "comment", "--comment", `"kubernetes forwarding conntrack pod destination rule"`,
    "-d", proxier.clusterCIDR,
    "-m", "conntrack",
    "--ctstate", "RELATED,ESTABLISHED",
    "-j", "ACCEPT",
  )
}
```

The interesting part of this rule that it already matches conntrack state to "RELATED,ESTABLISHED",
which means that it does not apply to the initial packet, but after the connection has been setup
and accepted.

In this case, dropping the `-d proxier.clusterCIDR` rule should have minimal impact on it behavior.
We would just be saying that if any connection is already established or related, just accept it.

In addition since this rule is written after the rule to drop packets marked by `KUBE-MARK-DROP`,
by the time we reach this rule, packets marked to dropped by kubernetes would already have been dropped.
So it should not break any kubernetes specific logic.

Unfortunately in this case, it's not possible replace the cluster CIDR rule with local CIDR as
the traffic could be getting forwarded through this node to another node.

### Risks and Mitigations

The biggest risk we have is that we are expanding the scope of the last rule to potentially include
non-kubernetes traffic. This is considered mostly safe as it does not break any of the intended 
drop behavior. Plus once the initial connection has been accepted, assuming nodes are used
for kubernetes workloads, it's highly unlikely that we would need to not accept it later.

## Design Details

### Graduation Criteria

TODO

##### Removing a deprecated flag

The core proposal is to retain the current cluster CIDR flag in kube-proxy and add additional ones
for the new behavior without deprecating the old one.

## Implementation History

2019-11-04 - Creation of the KEP

## Drawbacks [optional]

The main caveat in this KEP is the relaxation of the accept rule for "ESTABLISHED,RELATED" packets.
The other two rules have equivalent implementations, as long as we continue to guarantee that pod
traffic is routed at the node boundary on _every_ and _all_ nodes that makes up the kubernetes cluster.
This would not work if that assumption were to change.

## Alternatives [optional]

### Multiple cluster CIDR rules
One alternative to consider is to explicitly track a list of cluster CIDRs in the ip table rules.
For the second rule and third, it would be a simple source match to each of the CIDRs.
But for the first rule, we would have to do a new mark and then masquerade on absence of mark,
as we have to make sure it does not match _any_ of the allocated CIDRs.

It also complicates the lifecycle of kube-proxy as when new cluster CIDRs are added, this has to
be plumbed down to kube-proxy (either change flags and restart or create a new resource to watch).

It is felt it's better to have kube-proxy unlearn knowledge of cluster CIDR instead of adding to it.
